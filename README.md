# marzeq/dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles for my personal use. It also contains an `install.sh` script that will allow you to install my sway desktop and some other programs I might use.

Included in the sway desktop:

-   User space programs:
    -   sway
    -   rofi
    -   alacritty
    -   neovim
    -   code new roman nerd font
    -   bash dotfiles
    -   gtk theme
-   Under the hood stuff:
    -   xorg-xwayland (for runnning rofi and other x11 programs)
    -   xsettingsd (for gtk theme)

Other programs that I might use:

-   Discord
-   Github CLI
-   NodeJS
-   yay

The installer works best on Arch Linux (any distro with the arch repos _should_ work), and might work on Debian-based systems (though I haven't tested it).
